# Find k closest elements
Given an array of sorted integers arr, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.

# Find K largest elements of a max heap
Take k number of elements of a max heap and return them in a list

# Find kth smallest prime fraction
Given an array of prime numbers in ascending order and an integer k, return the kth smallest prime fraction in the array. Since the answer is a fraction, return it as an array of integers [numerator, denominator].

# Find the shortest sub array with sum atleast k
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the length of the shortest continuous subarray with sum at least k. If there is no non-empty subarray with sum at least k, return -1.

# Find k frequent elements in an array
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. Return the answer in any order
